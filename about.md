Aquaponics is a method of raising fish and vegetables together in a symbiotic relationship. Waste water from Tilapia fertilizes plant crops, and upon absorbing those nutrients, the plants purify the water for the fish. Because the water recirculates in this way continuously, our system conserves 90% of the water that conventional farming methods lose to runoff and evaporation.
